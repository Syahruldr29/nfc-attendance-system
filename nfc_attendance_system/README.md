# NFC Attendance System (Minimal GitHub-ready)

This is a minimal skeleton of an NFC (UID) attendance system prepared for GitHub.
It includes a basic backend (TypeScript/Express), a tiny Next.js frontend, and Docker Compose.

## Quick Start (local)
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit if needed.
2. Run with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
3. API: http://localhost:4000
   Web: http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- This repository is a minimal starting point (skeleton). Fill in detailed logic, security, and production settings before use.
- See `server/` and `web/` folders for implementation.
